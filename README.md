# VoxelWorld
 A voxel minecraft like game developed with Unreal Engine 5.1 and with the help of https://www.udemy.com/course/unityminecraft/.
 
 The original course is in unity but i wanted to challenge myself and improve my unreal engine skills.

 Its going pretty hard for now :D
 
 I stopped developing this project because i wanted to focus more on c++ rather than unreal.
 
 Im currently developing : www.github.com/stopthem/2DGameEngine
